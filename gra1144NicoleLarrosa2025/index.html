	<section><h3>Steps</h3><ol><li>Cook the pasta:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook according to package directions (usually around 8-10 minutes). Drain and set aside, reserving a little pasta water.</li>
<li>Cook the chicken:
While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should be 165°F). Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes. Slice the chicken into thin strips.</li>	<li>Make the Alfredo sauce:
In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the butter. Once melted, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the heavy cream and milk, stirring constantly. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce thickens. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, and season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning (if using). Continue stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce is smooth.</li>
		<li>Combine pasta and sauce:
Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a little bit of reserved pasta water to thin it out to your desired consistency.</li>
	  <li>Add the chicken: Add the sliced chicken on top of the pasta, and toss everything together to combine.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Serve: Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and extra grated Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
